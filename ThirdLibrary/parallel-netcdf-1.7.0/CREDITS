Parallel-netCDF is a joint effort between Northwestern University and Argonne
National Laboratory.  We have also been fortunate to receive a great deal of
help from the community.  A partial list follows.  Thanks everyone!

- Parallel-NetCDF uses a great deal of NetCDF code, so the project would not
  have gotten as far as it did as quickly as it did without the efforts of the
  Unidata group.

- Joachim Worringen <joachim@ccrl-nece.de> and Rene Redler
  <redler@ccrl-nece.de> helped us build and run correctly on NEC SX-6

- John Tannahill <tannahill1@llnl.gov> contributed a great deal of effort
  testing and improving our Fortran bindings

- Richard Hedges <richard-hedges@llnl.gov> was another early adopter and
  offered a lot of configuration tips, particularly for IFC

- Renier Vogelsang <reiner@sgi.com> provided valuable assistance with the IRIX
  port

- Greg Sjaardema's <gdsjaar@sandia.gov> CDF-2 patch gave us and serial NetCDF
  large file support

- Jim Edwards <jedwards@ucar.edu> provided a great deal of assistance with our
  AIX port, and testing the nonblocking APIs.

- Tyce Mclarty <mclarty3@llnl.gov> also did a lot of AIX work for us

- Christopher Subich <csubich@math.uwaterloo.ca> contributed several configure
  fixes, improving our handling of cross-compile environments.

- Kurt Glaesemann <kurt.glaesemann@pnl.gov> contributed numerous cleanups for
  PnetCDF on ia64 with HP-MPI
