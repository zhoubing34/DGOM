== LAPACK 3.1: What's new  ==
=============================

 1) Hessenberg QR algorithm with the small bulge multi-shift QR algorithm
    together with aggressive early deflation. This is an implementation of the
    2003 SIAM SIAG LA Prize winning algorithm of Braman, Byers and Mathias,
    that significantly speeds up the nonsymmetric eigenproblem.

 2) Improvements of the Hessenberg reduction subroutines. These accelerate the
    first phase of the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem.

 3) New MRRR eigenvalue algorithms that also support subset computations.
    These implementations of the 2006 SIAM SIAG LA Prize winning algorithm of
    Dhillon and Parlett are also significantly more accurate than the version
    in LAPACK 3.0.

 4) Mixed precision iterative refinement subroutines for exploiting fast single
    precision hardware. On platforms like the Cell processor that do single
    precision much faster than double, linear systems can be solved many times
    faster. Even on commodity processors there is a factor of 2 in speed
    between single and double precision. These are prototype routines in the
    sense that their interfaces might changed based on user feedback.

 5) New partial column norm updating strategy for QR factorization with column
    pivoting. This fixes a subtle numerical bug dating back to LINPACK that can
    give completely wrong results.

 6) Thread safety: Removed all the SAVE and DATA statements (or provided
    alternate routines without those statements), increasing reliability
    on SMPs.

 7) Additional support for matrices with NaN/subnormal elements, optimization
    of the balancing subroutines, improving reliability.

 8) Several bug fixes.

 9) Timing have been removed from the LAPACK package. The TIMING need to be updated with respect to the new algorithms in LAPACK. We are also renovating the way FLOPS are counted.

========================================
== LAPACK subroutine interface policy ==
========================================

The interfaces to primary computational routines are fixed and
will not be changed by minor LAPACK versions (e.g. 3.x).
Primary routines are those prefixed by a precision and matrix
type like SGERFS, CUNMQR, ZHEGV, etc., and these interfaces
will remain the same for all LAPACK version 3 versions.

Most routines labelled as auxiliary are implementation
details for specific algorithms and may have their interfaces
changed by minor versions. Auxiliary routines are those prefixed
by a precision and LA like SLAQR3.  Some auxiliary routines
are of general use and are subject to the same fixed-interface
policy as the primary computational routines.  The current list
of fixed-interface auxiliary routines is as follows, with x
standing for a precision and yy standing for a matrix type:
  * ILAENV : Environmental parameters
  * SLAMCH, DLAMCH : Machine parameters
  * xLACON : Norm estimation, not thread-safe
  * xLACN2 : Norm estimation, thread-safe
  * xLANyy : Simple norm calculations (note: xLANEG is not related
    to these and may change)
  * xLASWP : Row interchanges
  * xLARF, xLARZ : Applying single elementary reflection
This list may grow by user request. 

The interface change for this LAPACK 3.1 version are:
   SLAR1V SLARRB SLARRE SLARRF SLARRV
   DLAR1V DLARRB DLARRE DLARRF DLARRV

6) Thread safe version of the LAPACK routines.

  Contributor:

    Sven Hammarling, NAG Ltd., UK,

  Comments:
  =========
    All the LAPACK routines are now thread safe except {s,d}LAMCH and the
    triplet {c,d,s,z}lacon.f, {d,s}lasq3.f and {d,s}lasq4.f. By thread safe, 
    we mean that your LAPACK library wil be thread safe provided that your 
    compiler is. Regarding the 10 routines still containing DATA or SAVE
    statement:
    {s,d}LAMCH can be manually replace by thread-safe routines (e.g. using
    F90).
    {c,d,s,z}lacon.f, {d,s}lasq3.f and {d,s}lasq4.f are left in LAPACK for
    backward compatibility, they are flagged as deprecated, and represent
    dead codes in this current release (v3.1).

  Changes:
  ========
     D   SRC/{c,d,s,z}lacon.f (D means deprecated)
     D   SRC/{d,z}lasq3.f     (D means deprecated)
