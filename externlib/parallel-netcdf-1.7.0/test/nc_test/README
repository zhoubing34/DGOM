This test is ported from Unidata netCDF-3.5 to test the functionality
of the PnetCDF API C interface particularly on a single processor. 

The typical way to run the test includes two steps:

 	(1) create test.nc by 	"<mpirun -np 1> ./nc_test -c"
	(2) run the test   by 	"<mpirun -np 1> ./nc_test -v"
