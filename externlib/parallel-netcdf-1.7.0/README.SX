# Current notes for NEC SX; based on pnetcdf version 1.0.0; 28 July, 2005

. SX Cross compiler environment is not supported yet (the check for a working
  ftruncate is not possible). Configure steps have to be invoked on the SX directly.
  Configuring on the target host and then cross-compiling works fine when setting
  up necessary aliases on the configure host (cc -> sxcc, etc) or vice versa 
  on the compile host (sxcc -> cc).

. With the following environment variables a libpnetcdf.a has been
  built successfully

    MPICC=mpic++
    MPIF77=mpif90
    FC=f90
    CC=c++
    FFLAGS=-dW

. Built on NEC SX6 with:
   - Operating system SUPER-UX 14.1
   - C++/SX compiler rev.061 2004/01/06
   - f90/SX compiler rev.285 2003/09/25

. Note on nf_test
   -dW disables promotion of Integer*2. However no interfaces
    for Integer*1 are built. This causes 2 compile time errors
    in util.F . Lines 1158 and 1226 have to be turned into valid
    Fortran syntax.

. Note on test_dtype
    The executables have to be compiled with -pvctl loopcnt=186048.
    To avoid run time error in test_array the vectorisation of the
    loop starting at line 256 needs to be disabled with
    #pragma cdir novector
